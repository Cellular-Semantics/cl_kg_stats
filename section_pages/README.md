# Section Pages

This folder contains one Markdown file per query from the **CL_KG summary stats** run.  
Each page shows the raw output of a single Cypher query as a clean table, without the collapsible
sections used in the main summary report.

These files are copied into the `docs/reports/sections/` folder of the **CL_KG** repo, where MkDocs
publishes them under the **Reports** section of the documentation site.

- Filenames follow the pattern `NN-slug.md` where `NN` matches the query number.
- Content is auto-generated by `scripts/generate_report.py`.
- Do not edit by hand â€” regenerate instead.

If you need to update or add queries, adjust the `.cypher` files under `queries/` and rerun the
report generator.
